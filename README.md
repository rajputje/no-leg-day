# No Leg Day
No Leg Day is a physics-based platformer game for android.
The player only has control of his hands.
The player can push, pull, hold onto ledges, ropes, etc., to avoid traps, collect coins, and clear the level.

## Why I made the game
I worked on a couple of games before this. But I had to stop working on them as I underestimated the time it would take to finish one.
So I decided to make a simple game and see it through until completion to get an idea of how much work it takes to make a game.

## Technologies
This game was made with the Unity game engine. <br/>
Assets used: Advanced Save System by Hendrick Haidenthaler, Camera Shake FX by LeastSqaures, Dialogue Editor by Runia Dev.<br/>
Note: A modified version of Dialogue Editor is being used.

## Launch
Just clone the repository and open the project with Unity.
